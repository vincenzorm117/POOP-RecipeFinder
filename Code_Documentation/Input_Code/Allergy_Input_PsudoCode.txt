Allergy Input Function Documentation

This file contains pseudo code for reading in allergy data from file.
All pseudo code is in an English sentence structure and doesn't use actual code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

if( file exists )
{
    Store all lines from the input file into a string array

    loop through all lines read in from file
    {
        1st run-through -> Store allergy ID number
        2nd run-through -> Store allergy name
        3rd run-through -> Create a new allergy object
                          Use stored data from last two run-through and current run-through for constructor
                          Add new allergy object to the allergy object list

        Increment the run-through counter
        If the run-through counter >= 3 then reset it to zero
    }

    return true to signal successful file input
}
else
{
    send an error message to the console (If there is time to do this I would like to have it sent to a log
    return false to signal failed file input
}
