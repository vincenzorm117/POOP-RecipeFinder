Allergy Input Function Documentation

This file contains psudo code for reading in allergy data from file.
All psudo code is in a english sentence structure and doesn't use actual code.
------------------------------------

if( file exists )
{
    Store all lines from input file into string array

    loop through all lines read in from file
    {
        1st runthrough -> Store allergy ID number
        2nd runthrough -> Store allergy name
        3rd runthrough -> Create a new allergy object
                          Use stored data from last two runthroughs and current runthrough for constructor
                          Add new allergy object to the allergy object list

        Increment the runthrough counter
        If the runthrough counter >= 3 then reset it to zero (A.K.A. 1st runthrough)
    }

    return true to signal successful file input
}
else
{
    send an error message to the console (If there is time to do this I would like to have it sent to a log
    return false to signal failed file input
}
