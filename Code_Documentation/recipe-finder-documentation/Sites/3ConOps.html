		<h3 id="CurrentSystem">The Current System</h3>
		<div>
			Currently, there are several recipe finder applications available online. One popular system is the <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/">epicurious</a> web page. The epicurious website provides searching and browsing services to enable users to find the food they are looking. We aim to create a recipe finder based on epicurious's but better by:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Implementing food safety filters on your search
				</li>
				<li>
					Providing a variety of foods that appeal and work for college students
				</li>
				<li>
					Providing nutritional facts for every recipe.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			From doing all of this, we wish to provide college students with great software to better nourish their dietary needs.
		</div>
		<h3>The Proposed System</h3>
		<h4 id="Needs">Needs</h4>
		<div>
			A new system is needed that provides better recipe matching than that of epicurious advanced search.
			<ul>
				<li>
The current system does not always properly filter dietary restrictions. The proposed system will not return recipes that include ingredients selected as a dietary restriction. This is important because users may be allergic to certain foods, and an improper filter could be potentially hazardous to the user's health. 
				</li>
				<li>
					The proposed system needs allergy disclaimers for recipes containing ingredients that are common allergens. This will be a preventative measure to protect the user's health.
				</li>
				<li>
					The proposed system will also provide detailed nutritional facts for all recipes to allow users to make more healthy recipe selections.
				</li>
				<li>
				The proposed system will also provide a broader selection of common recipes. This will be more useful to the average college student who does not want to spend a large quantity of time in the kitchen but desires a healthy, homemade meal.
				</li>
				<li>
				The proposed system will tag recipes as "quick and easy" based on a wide variety of factors. Not only will the system consider difficulty and cook time, but also equipment restraints. This will enable users with limited access to culinary equipment the ability to choose from a variety of healthy recipes.
				</li>
			</ul>
		
		</div>
		<h4 id="UsersAndModes">Users and Modes of Operations</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<caption class="blue"><u>Users</u></caption>
				<li><span class="blue">User</span> There will be only one class of user. The recipes do not need to be secured because they are already available to the public. Therefore each user will have the same level of access. There is also no need for trial users since the proposed system will be free. The proposed system will be a stand alone application, and thus there is also no need for an administrative user.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<caption class="blue"><u>Modes of Operations</u></caption>
				<li><span class="blue">On-the-Go</span> This mode of operation will select simple recipes that require at most 10 min. to prepare.</li>
				<li><span class="blue">Quick and Easy</span>  This mode of operation will select recipes that require at most 30 min. to cook.</li>
				<li><span class="blue">Chef </span>  This mode of operation will allow all recipe types to be returned, regardless of complexity</li>
			</ul>
		<h4 id="OpScenarios">Operational Scenarios</h4>
		<div>
			 The application will open and prompt the user for one of three options: On-the-Go, Quick and Easy, and Chef. At this point the user is given a selection of ingredients which he will select from to receive his recipe results. If the program crashes; the program will compile an error report and email it to our team, and the program will close.
		</div>
		<h4 id="OpFeatures">Operational Features</h4>
		<div>
		
			<p class="blue">Must Have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ingredient Input With Exclusions</li>
				<li>Selection Recipe search</li>
				<li>Food Safety Module</li>
			</ul>
	
			<p class="blue">Would Like to Have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Favorites/History and Popular</li>
				<li>Drink recipes</li>
				<li>Timer</li>
				<li>Mobile Capabilities</li>
				<li>Techniques for cooking Module</li>
				<li>Substitutions</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4 id="ExpectedImpacts">Expected Impacts</h4>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Raise nutritional value of regular college student meals
				</li>
				<li>
				Increase Health Awareness
				</li>
				<li>
				Enable students to prepare meals faster and with less decision
				</li>
				<li>
				The opportunity to try new foods
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h4 id="Analysis">Analysis</h4>
		<div>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Expected Improvements:</b> 
				The proposed system will not return any recipe results that include dietary exclusions. The proposed system will provide warnings in recipe results against common allergens. The recipes provided by the proposed system will have simple instructions presented in a consistent format. The proposed system provides recipes that do not require many culinary utensils.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Disadvantages:</b> 
				The proposed system is not online and will be only available to Windows users. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Limitations:</b> 
				The development team has a limited amount of time. The developers have limited prior experience with the primary tools that will be used to create the proposed system. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Risks:</b> 
				 There are many potential health risks to consumers, especially those with allergies. The proposed system attempts to thoroughly address common food health risks and common food allergies.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Alternatives and Tradeoffs:</b>
				The proposed system will be a stand-alone application unlike the current system that is a website. The advantage to a stand-alone application is the prevention of database failures, internet hacks, timeouts, and availability. Conversely, the proposed system will only be available to users with access to the Windows Operating System.
